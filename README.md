## Blogger App 
I have created this blogger app as a self project using react. This app has many features. You can also navigate from home page to about page, contact page, etc.
I have explained all the features of the website in this video: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2TKdcuDf-U)
# Remember to install files given in gitignore before running the app on your local server. (Because files such as node_modules which are large are not uploaded on github)
Some features of the app are as follows:
When you open the website for the first time, you will see two blogs. You can add your own blogs by filling out the form on the main page. You can also delete a blog. Please note that all three entries in the form (blog title, description, and image link) are required. If you leave any field blank and try to submit the form, you will receive an alert to fill in the missing entry. Your blog will only be added when you have filled in all the required fields.

When making changes to the blog list, such as deleting blogs, please exercise caution as the changes are stored in the backend and will persist even if you reload the page. If you update the blog list, such as adding a new blog, the updated list will be displayed upon reloading the page. If you delete all the blogs, a message will be shown indicating that there are no blogs to display.

Feel free to explore all the features of the website and try out all the options available.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
